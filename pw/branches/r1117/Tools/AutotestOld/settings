; Configurations to test
; The option has the following structure:
;   it's a ;-separated list of configurations mappings
;   each test configuration mapping is just a group of configurations. The first configuration is
;   the one used to build golden images if a test allows it.
;
; For example:
;
;     configurations = DX8 Release, DX8 Debug, OGL Release, OGL Debug; SW Release, SW Debug
;
;   means that results of cross-configuration tests (e.g. simpleTest, animationTest, but not
;   performanceTest!) are compared with results produced by the first configuration of
;   the mapping. For example, results of simpleTest for DX8 Release, DX8 Debug, OGL Release and OGL Debug
;   will be compared against results produced by DX8 Release
configurations = Debug, Release
