The success of the stage - the right choice of one of three options for the further development of events - will allow you to receive the reward and continue the journey. In case of failure, you will also receive a reward, but you will have to start the stage anew. With the increase in the complexity of the stage, your reward also grows.\r\n</br></br>\r\nTraveler's badges necessary to participate in the game can be obtained as a reward for the fight. The probability and amount of their loss depends, in particular, on the points earned in the battle. In addition, they are distributed the bonus of the first victory - having gained it, you can get a significant number of Traveler Tokens. As with other awards, with the active Golden Age, the number of all Traffic Tokens received for combat doubles. In addition, the Golden Age facilitates the passage of each stage of the mini-game, removing from the selection one wrong answer.",

A few days later you realize that they change their positions every night, but you can not determine where they came from yet - the swamp stretches to the horizon in all directions.
